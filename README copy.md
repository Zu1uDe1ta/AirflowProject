The solution that will provide the guidance to develop and effective study 
strategy to the Pythonista exists by leveraging a popular tool that is already
in use as a source for crowedsourcing solutions, we introduce to you to: 
StackSource. 

StackSource filters through questions that are posted to the Stack Overflow site
that pertain to the specific language or tool that the user is currently exploring.

" Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast
programmers. It is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Stack
Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features
questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. It was
created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer sites such
as Experts-Exchange. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008
by readers of Coding Horror, Atwood's popular programming blog. "

" The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, 
through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or 
down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Reddit. Users 
of Stack Overflow can earn reputation points and "badges"; for example, a person is 
awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an "up" vote on an answer given to a 
question and 10 points for the "up" vote of a question, and can receive badges 
for their valued contributions, which represents a gamification of the traditional 
Q&A site. Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the 
ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts. All user-generated 
content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike license, version 3.0 
or 4.0 depending on the date the content was contributed. "

StackSource in particular only considers the questions for the parameters that the 
user inputs, designating fields of interest. The data retrieved from Stack Overflow
does contain some sparse data, and part of the process within Stack Source, is to 
filter out sparse data and extract the useful data.
